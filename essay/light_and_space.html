                For a very long time in the human history, art has existed mostly in integration with space. At some point, however, the concept of power diversifying from the royal family and the church to nobles and individuals, and the concept of owning and selling paintings began to take hold. In addition, as the canvas was created, and the technology of paint developed, the painting was gradually separated from the space as it became possible to store and move without drawing it in a fixed place. Since then, architecture and art have separated from one concept and have walked their own ways.

                The artificial light has evolved into a light that illuminates the space and a monitor that contains screens and images, while on the other hand, technology has been created to directly shoot light to create a screen.
                It was a development in which people began to control light freely. A new form of art called Media Art has appeared.
                If previous paintings existed as visible to people in a way that received external light, they have now changed to a way that allows them to shine, even to live and to convey a message.
                The first media art started in the monitor, but as technology evolved, it began to sprinkle out of the monitor and into space. Now, wherever light can reach, it can be a canvas.
                What meaning does my canvas(space) have, and what message does the light that spreads there?

              <p>
                The office space does not allow me to spread or enjoy my inner abundance. There is no personal space allowed by the organized office. Those who pass by me just turn to my seat if they want to know what I'm doing. And as soon as I close the bathroom door about 30 seconds from my seat, I find the narrow physical space quite emotionally wide. The space that each person wants will be different, but the effect will not be much different. The reason for wanting such a space is not simply to need a place to hide or to avoid problems. Because such a space kindly explains; What type of person am I and what type of person do I wanted to be, what kind of emotions and qualities do I responded to, what kind of life do I pursue, and what kind of problems do I have?
              </p>

                I wanted to convey my feelings about this space to others. And, luckily, that opportunity came. January 30, 2019, Visit to StuKa fest location: Nieuweekekhof 34a, this day found my canvas. A toilet in the form of an under-the-stair attic, not a typical square type toilet, I wanted to paint this space with pleasure. with colorful lights.

               Light is a medium that cannot be defined, but can only be interpreted differently according to people's mental philosophy.

              As I thought light was a good medium to transfer my subjectivity. I wanted to paint the wall with this subjective material to convey my meaning of the space and feeling.

              Space is a place occupied to some extent exclusively through clear defensive means or some form of communication by an individual or group. Also, space is a cosmological image, which is limited by natural elements, and also acts as a boundary element between regions and zones. This domain may be limited by some special human activity, or it may be determined by social conditions. In addition to moving from one reality to another, the space has a different meaning and experiences a transition in a space. For example, with of walls, columns, and doors. If so, can you say that it is a space only if you stand on both feet? Or can it be called a space only if my body belongs entirely somewhere? Can I move the audience to another place through the two eye holes?

             “Sight envelops potential other sense experiences and would not achieve its own definition as a determinate vision without them. It is well known, for example, that object vision cannot develop without movement. Every single sense experience is the envelopment in a dominant mode of appearance of infinitesimal (virtual) continuation of other sense experiences.”

             When I first read the article, I wanted to research about why and how my body reaction doesn’t well-connected to my brain. Reach to a question like ‘Why can’t I directly aware the pain?’. There was a sense of shame, but on the one hand, I was wondering about, could there be a number of cases that deviated from this logic? Really, does the sense work at any time, integratedly? I wanted to experiment in my own way. And is this experience valid even in a non-physical space? I wanted to create an experience without this other sense experience. Using the element of kaleidoscope.
           </p>
           <p>
             * Originally, Brewster created a kaleidoscope from an academic motive to explore the reflection of a mirror from a mathematical and optical point of view. However, people were more attracted to the brilliant aesthetic effects produced by kaleidoscope than to hard math or optics. Thanks to this, the kaleidoscope has become a playful equipment. In that sense, it was walking the opposite path of the microscope or telescope. (David Brewster, a Scottish physicist, patented the kaleidoscope in 1817).
           </p>
           <p>
             The kaleidoscope has two faces. One is the face of cold science. The patterns in the kaleidoscope are mathematically multiplied and geometrically distributed without error. The other is a cozy fairy tale face. The hole that took Alice to a wonderland, it’s hole instantly takes the viewer into a fantasy world. A dreamy effect created by a strict mathematical order. This paradox is the charm of kaleidoscope.
           </p>
           <p>
             I was working with small prototype of LED kaleidoscope.   I do believe that the time of everyday stops for a person who is devoted to ‘play’. It is another time zone that flows through ‘play’. The hole in the kaleidoscope takes us out of our daily lives and allows us to live in new time zones. The elements of the kaleidoscope are finite, but the 'situation' of their combination is infinite. Flowing through the room of a still mirror is another time, a time of echolocation, which creates a situation of infinity with a finite combination. I found that it is interesting that the separation of space can be seen as a metaphorical use of time discrepancies. By concentrating only on visual part, I tried to break down the boundaries of the notion of actual space that people have.
           </p>
           <p>
             Then I came up with questions like ‘What is sense of vision?’, ‘What if I put totally different input to each of eyes?’, ‘Then how does our brain interpret the information?’. My previous prototype was only for one eye, but I made another hole for another eye. My eyes and brain have struggling to digest totally new information and experience. It was a bit dizzy experience gazing both colorful LEDs (but at one point, I realize that my fixating eye is my left eye). The experience along with separating myself from the kaleidoscope world to actual space, and separating visual information from each eyes took a while to adjust.

             I'm a observer, but I can't control the scenery that appears on my eyes. At this time, am I a true subject and is the world in the kaleidoscope an object? Or, is the unpredictable world a subject, and am I an object consciously looking into it? And where did I exist at that moment? Was it in a space that I was facing through the hole? Or was I in the space I was standing on?
