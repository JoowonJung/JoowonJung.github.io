                An example of an ostrich is often given when you liken someone who is ignoring the coming anxiety. Ostrich is overwhelmed by the fear when the threat comes, just putting his head on the ground and closing his eyes without doing anything. Sometimes our actions resemble that of an ostrich. It is not because you are foolish and do not know what to do. Rather, you know how to do it, but the burden and fear of the situation is too much so that you choose to ignore it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Avoiding situations that cause discomfort and fear has the ability to relax us in the short term. Rather than relaxing, it calms our minds from the fear that we may imagine which might happen in the future. When I'm confused or lost while I am making work, I just have a cup of tea and try not to think about it. However, the effect of this avoidance usually does not last long. We usually expect evasion to bring us stability, but in reality, it does not, but rather leads us to the discomfort mind zone. Although evasion can flee from an uncomfortable reality for a while, there is no way we can fundamentally escape from our minds.
              </p>
              <p>
                What does it mean that we can't get away from our minds? It means that we cannot stop imagining which spontaneously comes to our minds. When we avoid something frightening or disgusting, it is forgotten if it is as meaningless in my life as the dirt on the road. But if it is something that has a big meaning in life, such as exams, job search interviews, and interpersonal relationships, you will not be able to avoid thinking of it. Even if you leave and avoid the situation, your mind will still remain in that situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Psychoanalyst Freud said that coming from outside danger was fear, and he used the term 'anxiety' as he found out that internal danger could be feared as well. People want to turn away or quickly get rid of such anxiety because it is painful. This is the same as fear. Sigmund Freud, who talked about anxiety, said that it's time to feel fear when we accept or ignore reality as we want to understand rather than face it and solve problems. These actions were called "self-deceptive" and were viewed as a psychological aspect of protecting oneself by minimizing negative emotions.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, the most attractive alternative we can take is 'flexibility'. We are trying to establish a single principle of life, such as “Everything we encounter will be solved perfectly and nicely,” or “If you feel uncomfortable, you should avoid it.” However, there is no principle that can be applied in common to all situations, and principles that were valid and useful in the past may now be inefficient and irrational. The attitude we need is to think about how to act now in every situation, every moment, and in the most meaningful way, and then respond differently and flexibly at that time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then How to get to the flexibility?

                The work that I made in 2017, which is right before heading to Netherlands, seems to be a good to start up this section.  The reason of I making the work was from just a simple sentence. Ex boyfriend’s words, lightly thrown at me, “If you have a minute, how about a cup of coffee?”. Which makes my head complicated in a instant. Though these kinds of small triggers often cause big emotional changes in everyday life and shake repetitive and stable lives to disorganized mental state.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently I was in similar situation but more in emotionally overwhelming way. Felt like being tied somewhere and being manipulated by whichever bothers me. Looking back over this period, it didn't happen for one reason but through a series of interactions between events. I want to write some of the events which can explain the starting point of works (Title: Fragility/ Voice).
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the beginning of semester, the emotional burden has been piled up. The pressures of making a great masterpiece, of having difficulty adjusting my body to Nederland’s time (I spent a month in Korea, and it has an 8hour time difference) and of getting myself ready to the regular routine had risen. By that time, I was building an emotional tower that was about to collapse sooner or later. And this accumulated toxin of emotions ran toward its limits when I was heading to New York.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a study trip, I assumed it must be tougher than my own pace trip. Yes, it was. Not because of that I was sick for a while and couldn’t join the program, or I missed a lot of things that I can obtain. Or listening the story of how to survive in competitive city, always be prepared to socialize, and how exhausting it is from Korean who lives there. Those were okay, my emotion was under my control. it was all fine. Then it was not.
              </p>
              <p>
                I heard from my friend on Monday about A (A; a person who is best friend of my best friends from their high school). When I heard that she doesn't exist in the world anymore, my system broke down. Even I was not close to her. More or less, we knew each other’s existence. Though I knew quite well about her, where she recently moves to, which company she wants to get in, her life goal, boyfriend, etc. Trivial information from mundane conversation with my best friends. Like others, we like to share our lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the moment I heard about her, I kept casting a spell ‘she is just acquaintance, Joowon, you did not lose anyone. You don’t really know her. It is okay.’ It obviously did not work. Like I mention in line 15 (paragraph 3), ‘But if it is something that has a big meaning in life, you will not be able to avoid thinking of it. Even if you leave and avoid the situation, your mind will still remain in that situation’, I have come to think about what life and death are, whether God really exists, whether there is a next life. Multiplying these philosophical questions that no one is able to answer me, I sank into lethargy. It was not like ‘I am depressed, and I don’t want to do anything.’, ‘I would rather enjoy this moment of depression.’, nor didn’t justify with my emotion for an excuse for not making an art.
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn't want this depression to be written in some way in my work. As my work is the archive of the moments that I want to cherish and archive.

               “I do believe that I see a world through a filter 'I'. And make a work through a filter. 'I'. So, the starting point and intention of works are basically logging my daily life (current moments) and showing who I am with my work. My days, sometimes it was fun, or it might have been annoying moments. But all of those moments are something I wanted to remember or wanted to share. I may be writing my diary in the form of artwork.”

               The work will arouse the same feeling that I had, and probably recall to my mind and will hit me again. So, this time, I need to set up for a new work which has these criteria. First, use a method ‘repetition’ that allows me to concentrate on actions only. Second, hide core meaning inside.
               It was inspired by past work -tea set- with the process of emotional release through repetition.

               To visualize idea, I use stuffs; The word ‘stuff’ seems sloppy, but I wanted to express how I perceive it; I do not want to sugarcoat it. Stuffs for example, Poker cards I bought on Inter toy, drawn by the YouTube video about card trick. Uncoated copper wire; I should have bought enamel coated copper wire. LCD pigment, after watching a video from ‘Simply Nailogical’ channel. Black 3.0 paint, from reading article about new version of black color was released (against to Anish Kapoor). Home Surveillance camera purchased with anxiety after my underwear was stolen. And LCD monitors those which only 7 euros each, on Market place on Facebook.

               About the work Fragility, I wanted to articulate the idea of ‘one is closely related to the other’. When one element is removed, the other elements are instantly affected. From a distance, it seems solid and well woven wall of cards, indeed, it is holding each other, fighting from gravity ceaselessly.
