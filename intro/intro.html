            The starting point and intention of works have been logging my daily life (current moments) and showing who I am with my work. My days, sometimes it was fun, or it might have been annoying moments. But all of those moments are something I wanted to remember or wanted to share. I may be writing my diary in the form of artwork. But it has been with a little transition in its context.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beforehand, daily-life based work was more like driven by curiosity and with an attitude of tiny rebellion. Like, ‘What if things are alive?’, ‘What if the Led light can be moved one to another like fire does?’, ‘Couldn’t I make locker which doesn’t seem like a locker, what about twist the concept of password?’, or ‘How can I express anger in a different action because expressing anger is often considered immature when you show with an action.
          </p>
          <p>
            The question of what kind of person I will be in the future, what kind of job I will have, what goals I want to achieve, etc., are not new to me, which I have got for a lifetime. I have become accustomed and dull to worrying about these problems. Then things which are supposed to be easy and mundane, no longer are, get me into a new stage. Things, for example, the rules for bicycles are very subdivided here, separate toilets and showers are kind of new to me, a different system for going to the hospital, no 24-hour convenience store so need to store food before the shop closes, etc. The realm of familiarity no longer existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought where I come from was not a big deal at the beginning of the study year (for extra information, I never left Korea before I came here). However, then I have to face the reality that I needed to deal with cultural differences and needed to adjust myself in a new environment. I didn’t think of these differences while producing or making artwork, but at this point, when I look back on what I have done for two years were closely related to personal and cultural background. The works contain the log of me digesting all these external inputs and are gathered as one final work. The pieces of my time and experience of about two years are compressed as one collective installation.

            The underlying intention, the reason for making the work, and speculation of the subject can be checked through essays.

            The work that I produced while I had an art block. The repetitive action of stacking cards without glue was to express the feeling of how fragile I was at that moment (Photos in essay; Repetition).

            I wanted to express the feelings that I have about the situation happening in 2020. I can be the one who places oneself in the waves and mingle in the situation, or another who holds on and waiting for the hit to go off. I don’t mean that it exists separately or independently, because I am doing both at the same time. I feel like I am in the middle of the tug-of-war situation. I do work at home, try to find things that I can produce at home, utilize previous work, and give a variation and renewal personal website. What I also do is that thinking of a physical graduation show, and hope the situation gets better, and everything goes as before.

            I started to work with LCD monitors from the end of December. Then from mid-January, I decided this form of installation as my final. Tearing off the film on the surface, it looks like a broken monitor. Each monitor contains its own subjects, including videos of my previous works. Two main device that I set for this installation are, first, the video itself should be distorted. As it is not a promo video of the works that I made earlier. And I wanted to show distorted video as independent new work. Second, the reason why monitors look broken is because I didn't want to show my story clearly and want it to look a bit like spoiled. Because while creating these artworks, what I've been through was not an experience with an answer like an equation. And the message that most of the video content that I want to convey is 'My confused two-year’. So, I decided that it is not necessary to deliver the contents as ‘accurate information’ to the audience.

          <p>
            I show my perspective on things around me with various mediums. In my work, analog and digital forms exist without clear distinction. I don't want my work defined by one word. Hope final work delivers all these uncertainties, hesitation, thoughts, moments that I have been got through to the audience.
